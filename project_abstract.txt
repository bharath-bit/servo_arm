There is a matlab code which is capable of controlling
the servo robotic arm with 3 degree of freedom with the help of coloures(RGB)
written a simple matlab code which detects the colour and according to the colour detected the 
the servo motors are actuated using the arduino microcontroller.arduino is used for serial communication
,like some alphanumeric values are sent and so the operations are predefined for those values.
coloures are detected based on the pixel values from 0-255.
applications:
1.colour segrigation 
2.segrigation of bottles based on coloures.
3.segrigation of vegitables like green tomatoes and red for the farmers with huge fields.
4.weed seperation
and  many more...................
